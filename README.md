# Spring Boot and Angular CRUD Application

## Overview
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The application demonstrates how to create a full-stack web application with a RESTful API and a dynamic user interface.

## Backend: Spring Boot
The backend is developed using Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework for building microservices and web applications. It includes:

- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- **JPA and Hibernate**: Used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database operations.
### Key Features
- **Entity Management**: Define and manage entities using JPA annotations.
- **Repository Layer**: Create repositories for database interactions.
- **Service Layer**: Implement business logic.
- **Controller Layer**: Define RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.

## Frontend: Angular
The frontend is developed using Angular, a TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications. It includes:

- **Components**: Modular building blocks of the UI.
- **Services**: Handle HTTP requests and interactions with the backend.
- **Routing**: Manage navigation within the application.
- **Forms**: Implement reactive forms for handling user input.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive design and styling.

### Key Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement components for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- **Form Validation**: Validate user inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.
